# Fully Connected Network
Binary Classification with a Fully Connected Network

Visual Studio (2015) project with for binay classification using a fully connected network (FCN). This project extends the one [here](https://github.com/josemserra/LogRegressionInNNContext), which implemented binary classification with only one node.

## Step 1)
- Set up the project, by copying the previous implementation and organizing the classes for better readability/code organization/maintnence;
- Split IO into a separate class;
- Creation of an abstract ActivationFunction (later to be extended by the actual implementations of Sigmoid, ReLU...);
- Creation of an FCNet class that contains the network, associated data structures and method to train and then predict;

## Step 2)
- Initialisation of the weights and biases for each layer of the network;
- Added new definition of network;
- Added dummies for the activation functions;
